          The BLUECAP team has successfully conducted 693 community “Education
          and Awareness” programs,training participants in effectively managing
          post-consumer plastics. These include: 409 school programs, 14 fishery
          community programs, 53 women's organization programs, 217 other
          community programs
        </p>
        <p>
          Through these initiatives, 50,324 individuals were educated on the
          importance of responsible post-consumer plastic management and made
          aware of the negative impacts of plastic mismanagement on the
          environment. Additionally, the programs fostered the development of
          numerous entrepreneurs, empowering them to recover waste plastics and
          meettheir daily needs sustainably.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over 100 new collection points were established across 15 designated
          districts, creating income opportunities for onboarded collection
          employees to support their daily needs through BLUECAP's plastic
          collection initiatives. As a result of these efforts, the initiatives
          collectively facilitated the recovery of 50,000 kilograms of plastic
          waste for recycling in Sri Lanka, preventing this waste from being
          burned orimproperly dumped.
